# Backend Split Summary

## Overview
The backend functionality for daily posts and AI chat has been successfully split into separate files for better organization and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `clinic/daily_posts_views.py`
- **Purpose**: Contains the `live_posts_api` function for fetching health news from NewsAPI
- **Functionality**: 
  - Fetches health-related news articles from NewsAPI
  - Handles API errors and timeouts
  - Returns JSON response with articles and status
- **Dependencies**: 
  - `os` - for environment variables
  - `requests` - for HTTP requests
  - `random` - for page randomization
  - `logging` - for error logging
  - Django decorators for CSRF exemption and HTTP method restrictions

### 2. Created `clinic/chat_views.py`
- **Purpose**: Contains the `chat_ai` function for AI-powered medical chat
- **Functionality**:
  - Processes user messages and conversation history
  - Integrates with OpenRouter API for AI responses
  - Validates input and handles errors
  - Supports multilingual conversations
  - Includes medical disclaimers
- **Dependencies**:
  - `os` - for environment variables
  - `requests` - for HTTP requests
  - `json` - for JSON parsing
  - `logging` - for error logging
  - Django decorators and settings

### 3. Updated `clinic/views.py`
- **Removed**: The large API functions (`live_posts_api` and `chat_ai`)
- **Added**: Import statements for the new split files
- **Kept**: All page view functions (home, about, contact, daily_posts, chat_box)
- **Result**: Much cleaner and more focused main views file

## File Structure After Split

```
clinic/
├── views.py              # Main page views (simplified)
├── daily_posts_views.py  # Daily posts API functionality
├── chat_views.py         # AI chat API functionality
├── urls.py               # URL routing (unchanged)
├── models.py             # Database models (unchanged)
└── ...
```

## Benefits of This Split

1. **Better Organization**: Each file has a single, clear responsibility
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to API logic are isolated to specific files
3. **Improved Readability**: Main views.py is now much cleaner and easier to understand
4. **Better Testing**: Each API can be tested independently
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add more API endpoints to their respective files

## URL Configuration
The URL patterns remain unchanged in `clinic/urls.py`:
- `api/live-posts/` → `views.live_posts_api` (imported from daily_posts_views.py)
- `chat-ai/` → `views.chat_ai` (imported from chat_views.py)

## Environment Variables Required
Both API files require the same environment variables as before:
- `NEWSAPI_KEY` - for daily posts API
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` - for AI chat API

## Testing
The split has been verified with `python manage.py check` which shows no issues.

## Next Steps
- Consider adding unit tests for each API file
- Add more comprehensive error handling if needed
- Consider creating separate URL files for API endpoints if the project grows larger
